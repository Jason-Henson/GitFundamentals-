# git pull 

Simlar to a [git push](./PUSH.md), a `git pull` will interact with a remote repositry.  Only this time it will **pull** the changes it does not have from the remote down to the local repository. 

This means any commits made that are on the remote repository will be pulled down and added to the rlocal repository. 

This can be done by adding the remote and brnach name: 
```
git pull origin main
```

If ther is any upsteam connection established, you can use `git pull` without specifying ad remote brnach.
